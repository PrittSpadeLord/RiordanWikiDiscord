    <h1>CRASH CΦURSΣ TΦ USING DISCΦRD</h1>
    <h1><strike>FΦR DUMMIΣS</strike></h1>

    If you're reading this, you've probably just joined the riordan.wikia.com's official discord server and came here. Even if you didnt, and came across this as a way to learn what Discord is about, we're here to help. Let's dive in.<br><br>

    <b>Why the big fuss?</b><br><br>

    Well, Discord is an amazing messaging app, which has alot of features to help keep communities organized and trouble-free. However, with it comes a bit of complexity, especially to newer users of the platform who have never seen such an organized messaging app before. We do have quite alot of experience helping out newer users get familiar with both Discord, and the server. Lets check out some basic terms used in Discord.<br><br>
    
    <b>Discord Servers</b><br><br>

    You may have used other messaging apps before, such as WhatsApp, Facebook's Messenger, Hike, etc. You may be familiar with DMs (Direct Messages) as well as group messages, where multiple people can chat in a common chatroom. While Discord also has DMs and group chats, they take it up a notch, with servers. Discord servers have multiple chatrooms (also known as channels), roles, custom emojis, and voice support. They can also be much bigger than a group, with more than thousands or even tens or hundreds of thousands of members. Servers can be bigger and more organized than groups, and thus the Rick Riordan's Wiki use it as our main chatting center.<br><br>

    To join a server, you may do it with an invite link, that starts with either <i>https://discord.gg/</i> or <i>https://discordapp.com/invite/</i> or through the interactive widget placed towards the side of every Wiki page (on desktops). Server links may be limited on the number of uses or on how long they are valid. The invite link for Rick Riordan Wiki's server is <a href="https://discord.gg/nKJU53z">https://discord.gg/nKJU53z</a> by the way, which is permanent and has unlimited uses.<br><br>
    
    <b>Channels</b><br><br>

    Channels are the primary ways of communication within a Discord server. Channels may be text or voice. Text channels are very much similar to a group chatroom, except they can be more micromanaged to allow specific people, or groups of people (more on that in Roles) from reading and/or typing in a channel. Text channels begin with the # symbol and also cannot have any capital letters or spaces (this is to create a familiarity with IRC). Do not mistake the #channels for "hashtags". Voice channels are marked with the 🔈 symbol and are used for realtime voice chatting. We use voice channels for realtime voice chats and for listening to music (more on that in Bots).<br><br>

    You can access the channels list for a server by swiping from the left edge on mobile devices. On desktop app and the website, the list of channels is already present in the left side. Text channels can also be mentioned in messages by prepending with the # symbol.<br><br>

    <b>Roles</b><br><br>

    Roles are a collection of permissions that can be assigned to members. Its useful when you want to categorize the members in your server. Roles also can be assigned a color, the highest colored role you possess is the display color of your name in the server. The list of roles can be found in the #rules channel.<br><br>

    Roles can also be mentioned, doing so will send a notification to all the people the role is assigned to. This is true for the @Camp Counselor, @Praetor, and the @Olympus roles as they are staff roles. Misusing of this ability to ping these roles will result in consequences that wont be pretty.<br><br>

    <b>Bots</b><br><br>

    Bots are automated interactees in the server which can be programmed to achieve certain tasks or help around with server stuff. Several bots are used within the server, most of them being public and a couple of them are private. Iris and Terminus are our private, server-specific bots. You cannot add them to your own server. Iris is meant for modmail (or Iris-messages) if you'd like to contact the mod team privately, and Terminus is a general purpose bot that's used for various other server-specific needs. All other bots are public bots, and can be added by anyone. In fact, a few of them are found in almost all servers.<br><br>

    At this point, you are well equipped with enough knowledge to use Discord comfortably. You can safely head back to Discord and wont be facing any issues. You can continue reading for some additional info, if you'd like.

    <b>Custom Emoji</b><br><br>

    Every server can have it's own set of emoji that anyone in the server can use within the server. People who buy Discord Nitro, a monthly subscription, can use such server emojis outside their designated servers and also enjoy some other features, such as animated pfps, increased file upload limit, etc. Moderators and Admins can upload emojis for the server, but do not happen very often.
